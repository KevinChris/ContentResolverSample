# ContentResolverSample
This Project shows how to use [Content Resolver] (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics.html). An application accesses the data from a content provider with a ContentResolver.

I have already defined Content Provider in separate application in my another repository [ContentProviderSample] (https://github.com/KevinChris/ContentProviderSample). This repository explains how to access the database of ContentProviderSample database using Content Resolver.

In this application we covered,

1. How to create content resolver to access the database of another Content Provider application.
2. Retrieving all data, data based on sync state and displaying records in proper format.
3. Storing the record to ContentProviderSample database from this application.
4. Delete records.
5. Update records.

# TODO

1. Open files of type MIME
2. Accessing the internal files of an another application
