# ContentResolverSample
This Project shows how to use [Content Resolver] (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics.html). Once Content Provider is implemented in an application, Content Resolvers are used to access the data of another application. 

Here Content Provider and Content Resolver are separate applications. 

Before looking at this repository kindly check my [ContentProviderSample Respository] (https://github.com/KevinChris/ContentProviderSample). Using ContentResolverSample application I'm fetching the data of ContentProviderSample application.
